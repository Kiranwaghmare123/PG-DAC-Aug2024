### Day 5 : Algorithms and Data Structures
    ----------------------------------------
    Topic: Introduction to ADS
    Date: 27/9/2024
    Meeting ID: 832 1579 8576
    Passcode:	806920
    ----------------------------------------
    Topics:
    	-Linked List
    	
### Linked list: 
	-A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains two parts:
		-data 
		-reference (pointers) to the next node
	-In linked list, the elements are not stored in contiguous memory location.
	-Head pointer: It will indicate  the first node of linked list and the starting point of the list.
	
### Terminologies:
	1.Head: Pointer to the first node of the linked list.
	2.Node: It consiste of data and a pointer(reference) to the next node.
	3.Data: Information stored in the node.
	4.Link: Points to the next node in the linked list.
	
### Importance of linked list:
------------------------------
    1.Dynamic data strucutre : Memory can allocated and deallocated at runtime
    2.Easy to insert/delete element: No need to shift elements
    3.Efficient Memory Utilization: No contiguous memory required and it can grow and shrink according.
    4.Implementation of advanced data structure: tree and graph

### Types of linked list:
--------------------------
    1.Single linked list
    2.Circular linked list
    3.Doubly linked list
    4.Doubly circular linked list
